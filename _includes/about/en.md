Hey, I'm Yiyu (a.k.a.Road@Road) I love reading, all kinds of books are my spiritual food, immersed in the world of books, as if I can have a dialogue with countless interesting souls. Film is also an indispensable part of my life, through that side of the screen, enjoy the world, fantasy adventure. At the same time, I am keen on traveling, like to explore the unknown distance on the back of the backpack, every time I go to a new place, feel different customs, encounter a variety of novel things, these experiences make me extremely fascinated.

Welcome to my little world! In the vast world of the Internet, this blog is like an exclusive corner that I have carefully created, carrying my thoughts, feelings and sharing.

I started this blog because I wanted to have a space for free expression. Here, I don't have to be too constrained by the outside world, and I can speak freely. Whether it's the little anecdotes in my life, the moments that make me laugh out loud on an ordinary day; Or all kinds of difficulties in work and study and the summary of experience after overcoming them can become my words.

I love to explore different fields, from the in-depth interpretation of books and movies, to the magnificent scenery and unique people encountered during travel; From the curious pursuit of new technologies and new trends to the calm observation and thinking of social phenomena. And this blog is the platform where I bring these passions together and present them.
